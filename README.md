March Madness: "What Makes a Champion?"

Welcome to the group repository for our STOR 320 Final Project!
The theme of this repo is analyzing the postseason results of the NCAA D1 MBB Tournament from 2013-2021*.

The following files and subdirectories house related datasets, scripts and functions for analysis, and a to-do list.

(Also, the Google Doc for Questions: [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DtrEqQn_57FvkBzHd_l2Ha_twCo-XSWB30NJXAA2AtU/edit?usp=sharing))

*In 2020, no tournament was held due to COVID-19. Part of the Analysis will be dedicated to 'predicting' the field and, potentially, some scores!
