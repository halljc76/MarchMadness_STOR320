March Madness: "What Makes a Champion?"

Welcome to the group repository for our STOR 320 Final Project! --> **The paper can be found at Paper/GROUP10_STOR320_Final_Paper.pdf.**
The theme of this repo is analyzing the postseason results of the NCAA D1 MBB Tournament from 2013-2021*.

**NOTE TO INSTRUCTORS**

1. Clone Repo
2. Run HallScript.md chunks -- *after writing to any 'train_x...' or 'test_x...' file,* run the 'postseasonNet.py' after writing to the post.csv files, and 'seedNet.py' after writing to the seeds.csv files. **While the contents of this script are confusing and repetitive**, running it will generate updated files that are equivalent to the tables and visualizations used in the **GROUP10_STOR320_Final_Paper**.Rmd/.pdf files.

**What's in this Repo**

Data: Collection of all datasets used at some point during this project.
Cleaning: Chunks of code that have been used to prepare the imported data to HallScript.md
Analysis: The EDA paper script, the central script for preparing the datasets for the paper.
Paper: The python files and final paper files. 

**Questions**

If needed, email [this](halljc76@live.unc.edu) address with any questions. I'll do my best to answer them. 

**Disclaimer**

While I pushed the final copy of this repo immediately after running everything and ensuring its equivalency to what I already had in the presentation and paper, there's still a chance something could change. As of 6/23, the code does not error when run from a clean environment with the structure of this repository.
